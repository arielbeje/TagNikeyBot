# TagNikeyBot
We all know Nikey. That annoying guy with the Unicode characters name.

I decided to end his reign as a hard to mention person, and make a bot to easily mention him.

Can also be used with a customizable string to tag any person of your choosing, you just need to uncomment lines 11,12,25,26,27.
